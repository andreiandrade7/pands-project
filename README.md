# Scope : 
Project - Fisher’s Iris data set analysis

# Aim : 
Upload the Fisher’s Iris data set. Perform a series of analysis to the data 

# Files: 
   -Python script: analysis.py
   -Output text file: summary-report.txt
   -Output plot images: histogram.png, scatter.png, pie-chart.png


# Dataset description:
    -The current script requires as input the raw data named "iris.data" is corresponds to a matrix with size ( 149 rows X 5 columns). 
    -The first 4 columns represent the attributte information, namely: "sepal length" , "sepal width","petal length"  and "petal width" in cm
    -The 5th column (last) represents the classification of the of iris plant, namely : "Iris Setosa", "Iris Versicolour" and "Iris Virginica"
    -Each occurence, represented by a row  refers to a type of iris plant


# Script run:
    -Requirement: To run the script is necessary to have a  code editor plataform . The used for this developement was: Visual Studio Code 
    -The script is running by typing on the terminal :  python .\analysis.py
    -A sequential steps occur namely:
        .All needed libraries and the database are upload
        .A menu is prompted which gives the user the right to chose within a set of options:
            > vizualize numeric data
            > estimate a summary report of each attribute (example: sepal length(average ,maximum, minimum, standart deviation) )
            > Create and plot histograms
            > Create and plot scatter plots
            > Create and plot a pie chart
